## Six things needed for development success
1. an environment to develop in
2. a process to develop under
3. an established means to communicate with other members on the team
4. patience with ourselves and others
5. acceptance that not everyone has the same skills, the same methods of solving problems, the same methods of communicating
6. leadership promoting the importance of items 1 - 5

## What is Rails? Why do we use it? What is a "full stack"?
The front end, what you see and runs in the browser: HTML/CSS/jQuery
The back-end is the part of the app that stores and manipulates the data.
Except for all the exceptions. Explain.
